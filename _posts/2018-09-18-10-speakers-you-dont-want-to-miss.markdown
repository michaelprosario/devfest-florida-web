### Smooth Criminals, Android animations and how not to get robbed.

"How did they do that?!!!"
How many times have you been just stunned, STUNNED by the work you see others do in a fully native app? Smooth, layered animations for every transition that work on even $20 phones?
Its not magic and it may not be as difficult or as “mathy” as you might think. “Wow” effects that impress and delight!
We will be covering how to use multiple ways to accomplish a standard set of animations and much slicker more complicated ones using native and external libraries.

From the native side we will cover topics like using animation xml definitions, Material Design AppCompat included tools, moving through Animation Properties, Listeners, View Animators, Animation Sets, even AnimatedVectroDrawables, Morphs, and libraries like Lottie.

Stacy is a Google Developer Expert for Android, Intel Innovator, Google Developer Group Mentor, and WTM Lead.

### Flutter: Mobile Development for Busy People

All too often, mobile development is not for the casual developer. Creating an app that works well on iOS and Android can be a time-consuming process, requiring separate teams of programmers for each target platform with different frameworks, languages, and programming tools. This is made worse by the trend toward highly customized user interfaces.

Fortunately, Flutter is an SDK that puts the power to create beautiful, customized, cross-platform mobile apps back in the hands of every developer. In this session we will live-code a mobile app on stage to highlight how easy and fast it is to develop with Flutter, while showing off the latest new features. Flutter allows programmers and designers to experiment and play with their app’s user interface; new features can be added quickly and tested immediately; and the resulting app runs at 60 fps on both iOS and Android, while keeping the look and feel for each platform.

Emily Fortuna is a developer advocate on the Flutter team at Google. When not educating about the awesomeness of Flutter, she can be found working on improving fairness in machine learning or acting on the stage and screen. She is an avid member of the nerdy joke appreciation society.

Lara Martín is a self-made Android developer based in Berlin. Her passion for Android made her transition from her background in science to software development. When she's not attending a tech meetup, you will find her playing video games.

Jupyter notebooks are data science’s favorite new tools, as they combine two things that we typically think of as separate:

1. A human-readable part made of text, images, and even video, all of which combine to form the introduction, write-up, and summary that you’d expect to find in a paper or report, and
2. An executable part made of code, which provides interactivity, performs calculations and analysis, and can generate live visualizations. It allows readers to explore the data, ask “what if?” questions, and see the results.

Jupyter notebooks are tools for people who work with data to collaborate. IBM uses them to “distill data into insights”, Netflix uses them to scale up their ability to work with their copious amounts of data, and you can use them to craft reports that completely show your work — the data you collected, the code you use to process it, along with your writeup of your findings and reasoning.

In this talk, I’ll walk you through the process of creating your first notebook, and using it to write your first data analysis report, complete with an executable part that performs the analysis, and a human-readable part that contains your conclusions. If you want to get into data science, Jupyter notebooks will be a key part of your toolkit, and this talk is your opportunity to get started!"

About Joey: I’m a big proponent of Florida tech and geekery in the “Orlampa” corridor. If you look on my blog, GlobalNerdy.com, you’ll see that I’m the one who posts the official-unofficial list of tech/entrepreneurial/nerd events in and around the Tampa Bay area.

### End-2-End Machine Learning on GCP

Machine learning is hard, but setting up pipelines around ML shouldn't be. We will go through build a ML model on local, deploying it to Google Cloud ML engine and then use the exposed APIs to get predictions.

### Serverless Angular, Material, Firebase and Google Cloud applications

In this talk we'll learn how to use all the power of Google stack technologies (Angular, Material, Firebase and Google Cloud) to develop a full stack application. We'll learn how we can empower a serverless Angular + Material application with Firebase and reactive programming by using realtime database, Firestore, authentication (with different providers) and Firebase hosting. And we if need any other functionality, we can use Cloud Functions or a NodeJS app. This talk will demonstrate the overview of a real world application (40k users), along with CI configuration and some details of the code (the good parts!).

Design languages, like Material Design, are a great way to ensure consistency and best practices in your UI. But adhering to a design language won’t result in a good experience if you violate the heuristics of good design, build an experience that doesn’t match the user’s mental model, or complement the work users need to do.

In this session, we’ll discuss best practices for using design languages and the common UX mistakes developers make and how to avoid them.

Angel Banks specializes in UX strategy and design for enterprise, finance, healthcare, and biotech applications. She has a background in front-end development, project management, and product management. Active in the Atlanta tech community, she is a Director of Women Who Code Atlanta, Women Techmakers Atlanta Lead, and co-organizer of GDG Atlanta co-organizer. She is also a conference-organizer for We RISE Tech and DevFest Atlanta.

In the world of software engineering, there are those of us who work daily on iterating-over, and improving, a single legacy application.

You might be interested in moving your UI toward a modern reactive framework; but how do you leverage this on an older system without dumping your original product entirely and starting over from scratch?

I've recently done this very thing - adding a VueJS front-end as the new face of an old Rails App, shifting the UI in piecemeal while supporting both old and new architecture with VueJS components.

In this presentation I'll walk you through the process as a case-study and you'll discover:

- How VueJS is reactive but also applicable as standalone components to an old (Rails) application.
- How to break-down your old UI into pieces that will become your new, reactive components.
- How to build these components up simultaneously in two ways - legacy style and beta style.
- How to apply standalone components to your legacy app and launch them in a way that  transitions users gradually to a new SPA experience.

Michele is an in-house Front-End Engineer for Vox Media, building innovative software solutions enjoyed by the millions of fans of websites such as Polygon, The Verge, Recode.net, SBNation, Eater, Vox and more.
